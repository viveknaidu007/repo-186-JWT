    "Great question! In typical JWT-based authentication systems, you don't need to store the JWT token on the server side. Here’s why and how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **JWT Storage and Usage on the Client Side**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT token and sends it back to the client. The client (usually a frontend app or a mobile app) stores this token locally, typically in one of the following places:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Storage**: A common choice for web apps to store tokens.\n",
    "- **Session Storage**: Another option, especially if the token is only needed during a session.\n",
    "- **In-Memory (volatile)**: For security-sensitive applications, tokens are kept only in memory and cleared when the app or page is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once stored, the client includes the JWT token in the `Authorization` header of each subsequent request to the server to access protected resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example header with JWT:**\n",
    "```http\n",
    "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **No Server-Side Storage Needed**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike session-based authentication, JWTs are **stateless** and don’t require server-side storage. The server doesn’t keep track of each user’s token. Instead, each request sent by the client includes the JWT token, which the server then verifies by decoding and checking its signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This statelessness is one of the main advantages of JWT:\n",
    "- **Scalability**: The server doesn’t have to store session information, which simplifies scaling across multiple servers.\n",
    "- **Decentralized Security**: The token itself carries the necessary information (such as user identity and permissions), meaning the server only needs to validate the token without referencing stored session data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Token Expiration and Renewal**\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent indefinite token validity, JWT tokens typically include an expiration time (`exp` claim). When the token expires, the user must either:\n",
    "- **Log in again**: The server will generate a new token upon successful re-authentication.\n",
    "- **Use a Refresh Token (Optional)**: Some implementations use a secondary, long-lived token called a refresh token. If the JWT expires, the client can use the refresh token to get a new JWT without forcing the user to log in again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No need to store the JWT on the server**: The client stores it and includes it with each request.\n",
    "2. **Stateless Authentication**: The server validates the token with each request without session storage.\n",
    "3. **Token Expiration**: Expiration time is usually set to limit token lifetime, with optional refresh tokens for re-authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your case, just generate and send the JWT to the client on login, and the client will handle storing and sending it with each request for as long as it is valid."
